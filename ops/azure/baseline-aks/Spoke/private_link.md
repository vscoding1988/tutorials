# Subnet to host Private Link endpoints

A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network.
This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure
Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

- Azure Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure App Service
