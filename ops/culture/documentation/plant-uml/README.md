# Plant UML - IntelliJ
When I am creating `.md` files for my code, I often have difficulties to create diagrams. There are 
tons of good uml websites, plugins for confluence or even specific dedicated application for this task. 
Most of them have one major disadvantage you will to leave your application and use a tool for the creation, 
then make an image out of it and when possible export it as `.json` so when changes needed you can recreate it.
A good solution for this problem is [PlantUml](https://plantuml.com/) and it's integration to IntelliJ.
The best thing about PlantUML is also its worst thing, you are not drawing diagrams, you are coding them. 

## Setup
The setup ist pretty easy, install the PlantUML plugin from Marketplace, restart IntelliJ and you 
will have the option to create a new "PlantUML file".

## Sequence Diagram
My most common used diagram is the sequence diagram, a very deep introduction can be found on the [PlantUML Homepage](https://plantuml.com/de/sequence-diagram).
Let's start with the basic two-step flow.
- `Application` sends credentials to `AD` and requests an access token
- `AD` responses with JSON token
- `Application` uses the token to search for user with specific `$userId`

```puml
'you can find the file in diagrams/token_user_simple.puml

@startuml
Application -> AD: getToken POST /token
AD --> Application: return: token json

Application -> AD: getUser GET /user/$userId
AD --> Application: return: user json
@enduml
```

![save.png](images/save.png)

Now lets save the diagram as `.svg` image by clicking on the save icon in the navbar (on image yellow).

![token_user_simple.png](images/token_user_simple.svg)

The diagram may not be a master piece, but it is sufficient for our purpose, let's add notes about 
the response json. This can be done with the `note` command, you also will have to define where note 
is shown `left` or `right`. For one line notes you can use `note left: My note` for multiline you 
can use it as block:

```puml
note left
First line
Second line
end note
```
With json notes our config would look like this.
```puml
'you can find the file in diagrams/token_user.puml

@startuml
Application -> AD: getToken POST /token
AD --> Application: return: token json

note right
{
  "access_token" : string
  "expired_in": int
  "refresh_token": string 
}
end note

Application -> AD: getUser GET /user/$userId
AD --> Application: return: user json

note right
{
  "id" : int
  "name": string
  "email": string 
}
end note
@enduml
```

![token_user.svg](images/token_user.svg)

We can also define the order of the actors. To get a better idea let's add an `UserMapper` to our diagram.

```puml
@startuml
Application -> AD: getToken POST /token
AD --> Application: return: token json

Application -> AD: getUser GET /user/$userId
AD --> Application: return: user json

Application -> UserMapper: mapUser
UserMapper --> Application: return user
@enduml
```
The default order would be:

![default_order.svg](images/default_order.svg)

Actor which comes later, will be added later, but we can define all actors beforehand then they will be added in the
order of definition:

```puml
@startuml
participant Application
participant UserMapper
participant AD

Application -> AD: getToken POST /token
AD --> Application: return: token json

Application -> AD: getUser GET /user/$userId
AD --> Application: return: user json

Application -> UserMapper: mapUser
UserMapper --> Application: return user
@enduml
```
![default_order.svg](images/custom_order.svg)

We were to change the order, but the diagram is way messier that way and here we can see the disadvantages
of the PlantUML, we need to:
- add space
- change color scheme to black/white 
- make sure the text is on the right site of the line (I like text near the arrow head) 
- add activation to make everything a bit cleaner

```puml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceMessageAlign reverseDirection
skinparam monochrome true

skinparam participant {
 Padding 50
}

participant Application
participant UserMapper
participant AD

Application -> AD: getToken POST /token
activate Application
activate AD
AD --> Application: return: token json
deactivate AD

Application -> AD: getUser GET /user/$userId
activate AD
AD --> Application: return: user json
deactivate AD

Application -> UserMapper: mapUser
activate UserMapper
UserMapper --> Application: return user
deactivate UserMapper
deactivate Application
@enduml
```

Way better, there are tons of ways to customize your diagrams for more information I added the links below. 
## Class diagram

Let's see how we can create a simple class diagram.
```puml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true

package com.vscoding.plantuml <<Folder>> {
  object Product
  class ProductController
  class ProductService
  class ProductDAO
}

object Product {
  - materialNr: string
  - name: string
  - price: double
}

class ProductController {
  -service: ProductService
  +getAllProducts():List<Product>
}

class ProductService {
  - dao: ProductDAO
  + getAllProducts(): List<Product>
}

class ProductDAO

'relationship
Product --- ProductService : <<create>>
ProductController o-- ProductService : has
ProductDAO --o ProductService : has
@enduml
```
![class_simple.puml](images/class_simple.svg)

## Activity diagram

```puml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
start
:get documents in system;
:get documents remote;
:iterate over documents;
repeat :get next document;
if(document exists in system) then (yes)
  if(document is up to date) then (yes)
  else (no)
    :get full remote data;
    :map data;
    :update document in system;
  endif
else (no)
  :get full remote data;
  :map data;
  :create document in system;
endif
:log progress;
repeat while (next document exists) is (yes)
end
@enduml
```
